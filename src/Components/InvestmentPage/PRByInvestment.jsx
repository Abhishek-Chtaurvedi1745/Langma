                PR by Investment means obtaining permanent residency status in
                another country by making an approved financial investment. This
                could be through real estate, business ventures, government
                bonds, or other government-approved schemes.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4 text-[#0E2A46] text-[20px] leading-relaxed">
                In exchange, the host country grants you and your eligible
                family members the right to live, work, study, and enjoy social
                benefits often without strict physical stay requirements.
